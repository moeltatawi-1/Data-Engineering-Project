## Method in one minute

* **Pre-integration cleaning.** Duplicates, mixed-case boroughs, malformed ZIPs (`11201.0`), coordinates at (0,0), free-text vehicle types
  (hundreds of spellings → 6 groups), factor typos, inconsistent injury totals, impossible repair durations. Missing crash ZIPs (about a
  third of crashes) are **imputed by nearest-neighbour from coordinates** (≤200 m) instead of dropped.
* **Integration.** Both sides aggregated to ZIP × month (many-to-one), outer-joined with a one-to-one key check.
* **Post-integration cleaning.** Join-created NaNs → 0 for counts, NaN for undefined rates; duplicate borough columns reconciled; types fixed;
  full ZIP × month grid; low-volume non-residential ZIPs removed; anomalous ZIP-months flagged.
* **Two size-robust indices with different denominators** (so no shared denominator manufactures a correlation):
  * **HDI**, Housing Distress Index = urgent problems per complaining building
  * **SDI**, Street Danger Index = pedestrian and cyclist casualties per 100 crashes
* **Statistics.** Spearman and partial Spearman (controlling for building stock), Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square.

## Limitations
Correlation is not causation: income, housing age, arterial roads and reporting habits plausibly drive both burdens. Complaints measure
reporting, not conditions. Crashes are police-reported only, and crashes with no location are excluded. "Complaining buildings" is a proxy
for residential stock. ZIP codes are postal routes, not neighborhoods, and ZIP-level results say nothing about any single household.

## Prompts used


### Mohammed Walid 13003322

1. ok we went with zip code. a lot of crashes are missing zip but have lat/lon. how can I fill those in without dropping rows? here's what I have
2. how do I check if the filled zips are actually accurate?
3. we aggregated both to zip x month and did an outer join. here's the output. what do left_only and right_only mean and how should I justify this granularity?
4. for RQ1 I want to see if zips with more housing problems also have more crash injuries. bigger zips will have more of both though, so how do I control for that?
5. here's my RQ1 result. help me interpret it in a few sentences
6. for RQ2 I found these zips in the top 25% for both HDI and SDI, expected about these by chance. is that meaningful? how can I test it?

### Abdelrahmam farajallah 13003482

1. here's our date cleaning. how do I check for weird stuff, like lots of crashes at exactly midnight?
2. after the outer join some zip-months are missing. should missing counts be 0 or NaN? what about rates?
3. why would I need every zip to have all 24 months for time-series questions? here's our code
4. for RQ3 I want to compare the seasonal pattern of housing problems vs crash injuries, but the numbers are on very different scales. how do I chart them without two y-axes?
5. here's my RQ3 output. help me interpret it
6. for RQ4 I want to know if bad housing months line up with bad crash months inside each zip, after removing seasonality. how would I do that? here's my output. what does it mean?

### Mostafa Eltatawi, 13007048

1. I'm working on the data cleaning part of our NYC housing and transportation project. For the Housing Maintenance Code Complaints dataset, I need to analyze housing repair durations. Some records have missing, negative, or unusually long repair times. How can I use the IQR method and a justified 365-day cap to detect and handle outliers without removing valid observations? Also, how should I document and justify these cleaning decisions in our Jupyter notebook?

2. After integrating the housing and motor vehicle collision datasets using ZIP code × month, some records contain missing values due to the outer join. How should I handle these values during post-integration cleaning? Specifically, when should missing counts be replaced with zero, and when should undefined rates or repair durations remain NaN? How can I check for duplicate integration keys, inconsistent data types, and redundant columns to ensure the integrated dataset is reliable?

3. For RQ7, I want to investigate whether ZIP codes with more dangerous streets experience longer housing repair times. Our Street Danger Index (SDI) measures pedestrian and cyclist casualties per 100 crashes. How can I divide ZIP codes into SDI quartiles and compare their average housing repair-closure durations using an interactive Plotly box plot? Please explain how to handle insufficient observations, label the chart clearly, and ensure the comparison is statistically meaningful.

4. For RQ7, I am using Spearman rank correlation and the Kruskal–Wallis test to examine the relationship between street danger and housing repair durations. Why are these methods suitable for this analysis, what assumptions should I check, and how should I interpret the correlation coefficient and p-values? Help me explain the findings professionally while acknowledging that correlation does not imply causation.

5. For RQ8, I want to determine whether crashes in high-housing-distress ZIP codes occur at different hours compared with low-distress ZIP codes. Our Housing Distress Index (HDI) measures urgent housing problems per complaining building. How can I classify ZIP codes into HDI quartiles, aggregate crashes by hour, and compare the highest and lowest quartiles using within-group percentages rather than raw counts? I also want an interactive Plotly line chart that highlights nighttime hours (20:00–05:59) and clearly communicates differences in hourly crash patterns. How should I validate the calculations and interpret any observed differences?

6. Our interactive website is built using Python Dash and Plotly and includes RQ7 and RQ8 visualizations, KPI summary tiles, dropdown filters, and a Generate Report button. How can I verify that the charts and KPIs update correctly when users change borough, year, housing-problem category, or vehicle filters? How should I handle empty datasets, missing values, zero denominators, and insufficient observations? Please also help me document my cleaning methods, statistical analysis, visualization choices, findings, and limitations professionally in the notebook, ensuring the conclusions are supported by the actual data and no results are fabricated.


### Ahmed Raslan – Member 5 (13005475)

I am working on a Data Engineering and Visualization project called “Blocks & Streets – Where NYC Housing Distress Meets Street Danger.”

The project integrates two NYC Open Data datasets:

1. Housing: Housing Maintenance Code Complaints and Problems (ygpa-z7cr).
2. Transportation: Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes (h9gi-nx95).

The datasets are integrated at ZIP code × month granularity, covering January 2024 to December 2025.

I am responsible for investigating the following two research questions:

Research Question 9: When and where does combined neighborhood stress peak?

Analyze the relationship between housing distress and street danger to identify the ZIP codes and months experiencing the highest levels of combined neighborhood stress.

Research Question 10: Did ZIP codes where housing problems grew (2024 → 2025) also see injuries grow?

Investigate whether ZIP codes experiencing an increase in housing problems between 2024 and 2025 also experienced an increase in transportation-related injuries.

Your tasks:

1. Inspect the integrated dataset and identify the relevant columns and existing metrics.
2. Perform the necessary calculations to analyze housing distress and street danger across ZIP codes and months.
3. Identify geographical and temporal patterns and highlight neighborhoods experiencing high levels of both problems.
4. Compare housing problems and transportation-related injuries between 2024 and 2025 for each ZIP code.
5. Calculate both absolute and percentage changes to avoid misleading comparisons.
6. Investigate the relationship between changes in housing problems and injuries using appropriate statistical methods, such as Spearman correlation.
7. Develop two interactive visualizations using Python and Plotly:
    * RQ9: A heatmap showing combined neighborhood stress across ZIP codes and months.
    * RQ10: A scatter plot comparing the percentage or absolute change in housing problems against the change in transportation-related injuries across ZIP codes.
8. Explain the findings, identify significant patterns, and highlight important ZIP codes.
9. Handle missing values, duplicate records, outliers, and zero baselines appropriately.
10. Explain the limitations of the analysis and avoid making unsupported causal claims.

Technical requirements:

* Use Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Plotly where appropriate.
* Use the existing project dataset, column names, and metric definitions.
* Ensure all calculations are reproducible and statistically justified.
* Write clean, modular, and well-commented code.
* Provide clear chart titles, axis labels, legends, and interactive hover information.
* Ensure both visualizations can respond to the website’s filters and Generate Report functionality.

The final objective is to determine when and where housing distress and street danger overlap, and whether worsening housing conditions are associated with increasing transportation-related injuries across NYC neighborhoods
